**DRAFT FOR FEEDBACK**

Zex's 3d engine has to take data specifying objects in 3d space and transform them into a 2d representation on 
screen. This is how it does it.

Zex is designed as a simple 3d system. As such it's object defintions and control are equally simple. 


All objects in Zex are representable as objects built from simple (i.e. convex) polygons (Whereas General Polys
can be any shape, and have holes in them. Zex does not use these types). It is envisaged that a lot
of basic Zex objects can be dynamically generated rather than being pre-built. For example, functions called
cube, tube, sphere, pyramid,  etc. can be called to generate simple objects. This way we can define the core
background (i.e. the rather large spaceship we are flying over) with very little data.

To speed up matters, the internal representation of objects is done with an extended Fantasy object definition.

There are static and dynamic defintions of objects. The static definition is the definition fed into the game.
The dynamic definition is the object defintion when running in the game.



-------------------------------------------

Static Definition of a simple object.

Let's take a cube. The cube is represented as 6 polygons, and each polygon 
has a set of attributes associated with it. Simple objects are defined in object coordinates - that is 
all points are relative to the object's center point.

So, our simple object looks like this (All values are 32 bit unless noted otherwise):
Oreference: a unique reference for this object
Object_name:	char [32] - space for 32 characters that define this object's name (mainly for debug purposes - see the object
loader below).
Onumber_of_polygons - Uint32 - in this case 6

List of points - all points in the object are listed in three arrays as single floats: x,y,z
Ox: point 1 x, point 2 x etc
Oy: point 1 y, point 2 y, etc
Oz: point 1 z, point 2 z etc

The points are defined relative to 0,0,0 which is the object's central point, but when "owned" by an object are transformed
and rotated relative to the objects 0 point. This allows accurate model creation.

Connection array. This list specifies, for each simple polygon which points are used and how they connect.
Note that we do not define the backface of a polygon - this is auto generated at object load time if two_sided is set.
For example, the frontmost face of the cube could be specified as:
4,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,0,colour,texture,trasnlucency,special1,special2
which means: there are 4 connections: point 0 to point 1, point 1 to point 2, point 2 to point 3, point 3 to point 0		 	 
(Spcifying the last connection, whilst wasteful of memory should increase processing speed).
The colour: is colour of the plyogon (0-255 as a 32 bit value)
The texture: See Dynamic representation.
The translucency: is a value 0-255 where 0 is not translucent, and 255 is transparent as a 32 bit value.
special 1 and 2 can be used to specify some other effects.
two_sided: If set, the polygon has two sides, else 1. If set, the reverse side is auto_generated into the dynamic structure.

This data is repeated for all polygons that make up the object.

Finally come the rotation, movement and flags that affect the whole object:
rotx: single float 0-6.28 rads or 359 degrees. Rotation in x of object
roty: same as for x. Rotation in y of object
rotz: same as for x. Rotation in z of object
rotdx: delta x rotation
rotdy: delta y rotation
rotdz: delta z rotation *These are for objects which have no other direct control and auto spin around one or
more axis.
cull: If set, the polygons in the object are eligible for back face culling if the poly's two_sided is set.
If not set, and two_sided is not set then polys will appear to have two sides even if they do not. 
number_owned:	number of objects owned by this object
Oowned_list: Object references that are part of this object - a list of 32 bit references.

The Oreference and Oowned_list fields are important to the creation of complex objects and heirarchical control
of objects. 
For example, when this object rotates, the program can also rotate any owned_list objects.
When this object is removed, the program removes all owned_list objects AROUND THIS OBJECTS' ROTATION POINT.

Now we don't want to be searching for objects, so the owned list in the dynamic state contains ptrs to the objects
rather than references.

------------------------------------------------

Dynamic definition of an object.


Objects are transformed from their static definition into the dynamic definition under control of some level loader/filter routine.
The objects are transformed into an array called world_objects.
When transformed the points are transformed from object coord to world coord, thus moving the object to it's correct
place within the world. Note that all control variables are now at the start of the definition for quick acces.

Orotx: single float 0-6.28 rads or 359 degrees. Rotation in x of object
Oroty: same as for x. Rotation in y of object
Orotz: same as for x. Rotation in z of object

Orotdx: delta x rotation
Orotdy: delta y rotation
Orotdz: delta z rotation     *These are for objects which have no other direct control and auto spin around one or
                              more axis. These are added to rotx,y,z even if they are zero to save compares.

Omovedx:	delta x movement
Omovedy:	delta y movement
Omovedz:	delta z movement *These are for objects which have no other direct control and auto spin around one or
                              more axis. These are added to all the points even if they are zero to save compares.


cull:      If set, the polygons in the object are eligible for back face culling if the poly's two_sided attr is set.
           If not set, and two_sided is not set then polys will appear to have two sides even if they do not. 


Oworldx: The objects current x coord in the world - passed in from caller.
Oworldy: The objects y coord in the world
Oworldz: The objects z coord in the world

Visible: Is the object visible (from fov calcs - this drastically speeds up processing). Initially set to false so
object is not visible. (this way objects can be defined "over the horizon" without being visible for one frame,
the fov calcs will enable it as it comes into view, and disable it as it goes out of the fov).

Remove_object: If 1, then this object is removed from the object list on the next frame. Can be used by monster controllers to
tell the system when to remove an object. (i.e. a monster has been destroyed by player's cannon fire or kamikazee tactics).


control: A controller reference for this object. For example, 1 might mean this object moves back and for between two points,
2 might mean monster controller 1 should process this object etc.

**These next four can be used for various things to do with the controller - for example if a simple controller, control_use_1
might hold how many times this object has been shot - more complex controller might put a ptr to a data structure here.
control_use_1: 32 bit value private to the controller - could be a pointer it uses.
control_use_2: Ditto.
control_use_3: Ditto
control_use_4: Ditto.

OReference: The owner of this object - if top of heirarchy, this is zero.
**Now the object itself derived from static definition.
number_owned: is copied from static definition
immediate_children: (Compare to list of references in static def.).
number of polygons - Uint32 - this is computed from two_sides

Ptr to List of points - all points in the object are listed in an array of _3D as floats.
ptr to polys
(poly)
Ptr to Connection array. This list specifies, for each simple polygon which points are used and how they connect.
Face_normal: (Xn,Yn,Zn - float32) - see *note 1 below.
The colour: is colour of the plyogon (0-255 as a 32 bit value)
Light_value: see *Note 2.
The texture: Could specify a texture bitmap to be used for this plane or an actual texture
code used in conjunction with Light_value. See *Note3
The translucency: is a value 0-255 where 0 is not translucent, and 255 is transparent as a 32 bit value.
special 1 and 2 can be used to specify some other effects.
p_visible:	set or cleared by hidden surface removal.
eng_culled: Set by engine if it determines plane is too far out of line of sight for backface culling to be
            "visually" effective. i.e. if culled it could lead to planes missing or flickering (yuck!).
			(Yeah, this is a true stufrig variable but saves much maths (i.e. clock cycles)).

(Two_sided has gone (been processed) by the time we get here)
(end poly)

This data is repeated for all polygons that make up the object.


*Note1: For every polygon, this is calculated as the normal of the face. 
               Xn:=(Z2-Z1)*(Y3-Y1)-(Y2-Y1)*(Z3-Z1);
               Yn:=(Z2-Z1)*(X3-X1)-(X2-X1)*(Z3-Z1);
               Zn:=(Y2-Y1)*(X3-X1)-(X2-X1)*(Y3-Y1);
               { Normalize the normals }
               Module:=Sqrt(Sqr(Xn)+Sqr(Yn)+Sqr(Zn));
               Xn:=Xn/Module;
               Yn:=Yn/Module;
               Zn:=Zn/Module;

(A vector perpendicular to the face indicating (ultimately) whether the face is facing the camera or not
which is an improvement on the original Fantasy bfculling). We calculate angle between camera and face_normal - if
in the range 90-270 degrees, it is visible.
This normalised  vector is rotated as the poly is rotated so we do not have to keep 
calculating the normal of the poly for backface culling effectively cuttimg out much overhead on the culling.
It is a mistake to believe that if camera is fixed at some +z then the sign of the normals z component tells us whether 
it is visible or not! (objects to edge of the screen for example).

It *may* be quicker to say that if an object is offset by more than a few degrees from camera vector, then do not
backface cull it!


*NOTE2:
     CosineOfAngle=(Light.X*Poly.Xn)+(Light.Y*Poly.Yn)+(Light.Z*Poly.Zn);
     If CosineOfAngle>=0 Then Color=0
     Else Color=-Round(CosineOfAngle*16);

*NOTE3: Texture values. Values less than or equal to 1024 specify a basic texture as follows
Values greater than 1024 specify a bitmap to use.
0: Not reflective at all.
1024: Totally reflective (takes the colour of the light source) irrespective of the colour of the poly.
(Obviously the transparancy has an affect here too).

--------------------------------
So, how does it work...

Object Loader.

Lets take a simple example of a single cube. The object is inserted into world_objects as follows: 
1. rot, rotd and cull are simply copied from the static definition unless the caller provides override
values. current_rotx is copied from rotx, same for y and z.
2. worldx,y,z are provided by the caller and are copied into world_objects for run-time use.
3. visible and remove are set to false unless alternate values are provided by the caller.
4. control is copied from the object definition unless the caller provides an alternate controller value.
5. control_use 1,2,3,4 are set to zero.
6. OReference is provided by the caller and copied.
7. The x,y,z points are copied.
8. The connection lists are copied. If a poly's two_sided flag is set, the reverse connection list is also
generated and the number of poly's incremented.
9. Owned list is generated as a list of ptrs to the objects. This !means! that all child objects must be 
inserted before this parent object. If a child is not found the ptr is set to zero and a warning generated
along the lines of Object "Object_name could not find child x".

Basically, world_objs is the OCB's that control objects.


--------------------------------

RunTime.
We now have objects linked up in world_array. The player ship is ALWAYS at 0,0,0.
The game specifies ship_dx,dy and dz. These are the ship velocities along these axis.
Axis as follows:
+x is right
+z is in to screen
+y is up.

Polys are defined with points going anti-clockwise - i.e. we are using
a left handed system.

Now, the (simplified - i.e. non heirarchical object processing) runtime looks like this:

  1. Initialize all the local coordinates of every vertices - copy to world_objs as above
     whilst trasnforming their real coords from local to local plus world x,y,z's.

----
loop:
world) transform the object into the world and rotate it:
  0. If object is "on" then
  1. Copy relevant poly data into world_polys[] from OCB and update global poly count.
  (This includes a ptr to this OCB so subsequent processing can set flags in said ocb).
  
  2. Set the global matrix to an identity matrix. The global matrix is defined in 3d_top.int
  3. Scale the global matrix with the scaling of the object
  4. Rotate the global matrix with the angles of the object
  5. Translate the global matrix with the position of the object
  6. Multiply the local coordinates by the global matrix to get the world
     coordinates and copy to world_points (an array of points)
  6a). Copy the connection list into world_connex updating for sequential point count (an array).
  
view). transfrom the world points about the camera (this is all done in world_points[]
  7. Set the global matrix to an identity matrix
  8. Translate the global matrix with the negative position of the viewer
  9. Rotate the global matrix with the negative angle of the viewer
 10. Multiply the world coordinates by the global matrix to get the aligned
     coordinates

At this point, the points are placed in an array of points called
output_points.
We then copy the points offset into another array of ints called points_offsets,
this allows us to correctly locate the required points offset for each object
in future processing.

 11. keep going till all polys are done.
 
c). Backface cull, poly clip and light calcs for each poly.

d). Pers
 11. Project the aligned coordinates to get the screen coordinates

---------------------------------------
OBJECT CONTROL
At any one time, objects are being created and destroyed on a continual 
basis. Here;s how the basic object control works.

At the start of a level, all onjects for that level are loaded into the static
definitions:
1. The points are copied into points list pointer. The connections are
copied into connections_list_ptr. The points are local to this object, and
are transformed out of this array into the world array. The connections, again
are local. These are never copied - the runtime works from these points and 
connections.
2. The polyys are copied in Spoly_list_ptr.
3. The objects are copied into ocb_Sptr.

To load an object:
1. the object is copied from ocb_Sptr to ocb_ptr and various
parameters are altered, such as worldx,y,z etc.
2. The polys are copied into poly_list_ptr. Each poly is of a fixed size, but objects
have different number of polys!When we kill an object, how do we kill the polys? 
The only fast way is by stating that an object may have a maximum number of polys,
and assigning poly space in slots of this size. Currently a poly is 56 bytes in size,
so if we said that each object could have a max of 50 polys, then each active object
would take 3k in the poly space. We allow 500 active objects at any one time,
so that's an active object poly array of about 1.2 Megs.

Explosions
ЛЛЛЛЛЛЛЛЛ-
Explosions are simply a case of taking every single poly in the object amd making new
objects out of them. This is a very processor intensive task, but requires little
code and looks good. This code can be found in explode.c


Background graphics.
____________________
Are basically tiles layed out in columns viz:
xxxxxxx ->
xxxxxxx ->
xxxxxxx ->
etc.

Part of the data required for a level is a 2d map specifying the bg objects
to use. BG objects are identified by a four character sequence - such as ABCD
- this four character sequence is the first four characters of the objects
file name. In the object structure (ZObject) it is called Oid.

Each tile really has two objects, one low level (0z) and one high level (-100 z) - 
closer to the camera. Each tile is 2000x*2000y in size.

Supposing we have three low level bg objects:
B001,2,3
and two high level objects
H0001,H002

The first column of the 2d map could look like this:
B001,B002,B003,0000,z,H001,z,0000,z
bg1  bg2  bg3  none hl1  none

The high level objects have a height associated with them that specifies the z coord
for the object.
The first line of the file specifies how many objects are in a cloumn and how many
columns make up the map,i.e.
3,100 - objs_in_column, number_of_columns

Items are separated by commas. Lines starting with * are comments.
 
These map files are extensioned with ".zmp".
Ultimately these will be resources within a level file.

This .zmp is compiled by zex into this format called the cmap:
l1,l2,etc, low level objects for this column
h1,height,h2,height,h3,height - high level objects for this column 
Where l1,2... and h1,2... are pointers to the static object definitions.
Thus each column requires objs_in_column*3 locations
The current column can be found assuming that the map starts at x=0:
player_x/ 


The map loader when compiling the cmap will throw an error if an object can't be 
found in the static defs.

BG objects are inserted into the OCB's with a control value of BGobj. The controller 
for these examines the object location, and if not within the play area it is killed.
A new object is then loaded up "in front" of the player according to the cmap.  

Not all levels need hace a bg map.


Level Loader File - 12/1/99 SB
ллллллллллллллллл

This file tells zex how to set up a given area of "space". it contains refernces
to the monsters and controls, the bg map, where the ship starts -- anything that is 
necessary.
These level files are given the extension "ZLV"


All lines must start with a four character identifier as detailed below.

ZEOF - end of file.


SCRIPTING - SB 13/1/99
A script is a simple set of instructions that can control certain aspects of a level. A level script is run at a lower 
frame rate than the game. The script is not designed for precision control of timing events.
There is no guarantee that a script can be considered atomic - that is it is interuptable. Individual keywords and 
statements within a script are guaranteed to be atomic.

A script can contain an optional DEATH label. The DEATH label is where the script is executed when a monster dies.
A special integer variable MDEAD contains the 4 char ID of the monster that has just been destroyed. See examples.

Ten 32 bit integer variables are available as
A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K
Two 3d type vars are available as 3d_1 and 3d_2 - these have the members x,y,z as floating point values
and are accessed as 3d_1.x etc.
Two rectangle type vars are available as rect_1 and rect_2 - these have the members of top, left, bottom, right
as per a typical Mac rect but the individual members are floating type..

Assignment of vars is only possible between similar types or sub-types. Type conversion from float to int is
automatic. For example
let rect_1=rect_2 is fine.
let rect_1=A is not fine.
let rect_1.top=A is fine.

Numbers may be specified as:
Integer - decimal and 'xxxxx'
Floating - decimal only

Read Only vars
Time - returns a non-fractional and linearly incrementing number.

The scripting keywords are:
endlevel - ends the current level. A level also ends when zex is destroyed.
if var=var then
if var=number then
let var=var
let var=number

GetZex - returns Zex's current coords. E.G.
3d_1=GetZex

PinRect - is a point in a rectangle. Returns 0 or 1 E.G.
let A=PinRect x,y,rect_1

CountMon - count the number of active monsters with a given ID. Returns a number between 0 and max_dyn_slot E.G.
let A=CountMon MN31
(For animated objects use the id of the first frame)

DEATH: The label of the death entry of a script. A special variable MDEAD contains the ID of the just killed monster.
Follows the ESPT keyword.

LAMN and LMON as per the level loader will load a monster/object in the dynamic OCB's as per the loader - when used in
a script variables can replace parameters.

TEXTURES (OBSOLETE _ TO BE WRITTEN UP) SB
лллллллл
Are loaded in at the load_dyn_object function. Part of the parameter block associated with this function
contains either a pointer to the texture OR 0 for no texture. The uv part of a point will be -1 for no texture
for a given poly.


ANIMATION (Obsolete) To Be Written Up. SB.
ллллллллл

This is the extremely tricky one because:
a) The MeshWork file format has no provision for it.
b) It involves dynamically switching objects in and passing the relevent data between objects
c) Linking objects together to form an animation sequence, which is related to a).

Plan 1.
We get the level loader to load in the objects, setting an anim flag in the dynamic objects.
The anim bit is actually five members of a dynamic object as follows:

 0 - animation control. If 1 the animation resets to first frame at end of sequence.
     If 2, animation reverses. anim_control

 1 - Animation direction - 1 fwd, -1 backwards. 0 = stopped. anim_direction
 
 2 - Anim frame rate - how often the objects are switched. anim_frame_rate
 
 3 - Anim counter - used in conjunction with anim_frame_rate. anim_counter
 
 2 - next frame (dynamic objects slot number) or -1 for last frame. anim_next_object

 3 - previous frame (dynamic object slot number) or -1 for first frame. anim_previous_object

 4 - active animation frame. If 1 this is the active frame of an animated object. anim_active_object.
Engine examines this one to see whether the data needs to be passed through 3d stuff.

The loader is mainly responsible for setting these up.

The monster controller associated with this object is responsible for managing the animation.
It has find the next object in the sequence,  pass on all current data to the next object, and disable the 
current object. A new function called setup_next_anim_frame is used.

kill_it is responsible for killing all frames of an animated object. Once killed these objects are eligible
for overwriting as per a normal object.

Zex determines if an object is an animated object by the sstate of the previous and next frame flags. If both
are -1 it's not animated.


Docking/Undocking etc.
лллллллллллллллллллллл
When we dock with something we need to load in the objects describing the docked scene.
Because one can undock, we simply can't ditch the world else we would lose it's state.
We also can't save the world because pointers to polys are stored in teh OCB's.

What we have to do is:

Make a note of all objects that are in use in a local array called world_objects_in_use_state.

Next we load in the objects making up the current scene - these will be loaded above the world
objects. We make a note of their slots in docked_objects_start.

Then we set the in_use flag of all the world objects to zero (i.e. from zero to docked_objects_start), but we 
do not kill the polys slots, thus rendering the objects invisible to the engine.

Now we can render the frame.

To undock, we first kill all the objects making up the docked scene.
The we re-enable all the world objects, then eject the ship and render as per normal.


Controllers
лллллллллллл
In the game proper we need to give NPC's things to do. If we just blast them out of mother
ships the only thing they'll do is run in circles looking for things to kill.

We have just one controller for the game proper - NPC_controller

It needs to know what to do when not fighting and when fighting. NPC's can be one of two
types - travellers or fighters. 

Fighter
ллллллл
A fighter roams an area looking for something to kill. It does this by running in a large
circle looking for things to attack. It will not attack motherships.

Traveller
ллллллллл
This NPC travells from one mothership to another, when it gets there it will request 
dock, and when docked will add the that motherships quota of ships,

Guard
ллллл
This NPC simply sits somewhere and guards something. If anything nasty comes into it's 
field it will attack that something and then return to guarding.


Common Control
лллллллллллллл
There is one controller. It looks at the attack_what field and if set and the attack_what
is alive goes runs the combat routine.
The controller works in conjunction with the laser_class, gun_class and number of missiles
and class attributes.
Another attribute is aggressive - if set the controller will always try to find something
to attack. This would be set for fighter and guard but not for traveller.

Flow
лллл
do avoid
check attack - if set run fight.
If not set decode type - fighter, traveller, Guard and run the right routine.

Shields are decoded from the shields_class as follows:
1 - not rechargeable
>1 recharge rate per frame (recharges to original_shield_value)

If shields drop below 300 the NPC will try to run if it has rechargeable shields.

If shields below 50 NPC will try to eject.


Time_Out
лллллллл
All NPC's use this field to decide when to dock with a mothership - it's
incremented every frame and when gets to a certain point the NPC will make its
class TRAVELLER, find the nearest mothership and try to dock.



Mothership Memory Management
лллллллллллллллллллллллллллл
Motherships need more memory than the OCB allows. So a simple memory manager dishes out 
and releases blocks of memory for motherships. A ptr in the OCB - mship_ptr is filled
with a valid address or 0.

The motherships controller examines its mship_ptr and if zero calls
mship_get_mem and then inits the structure
mship_get_mem returns either a good ptr or 0 if one can't be found. It does a simple
serial search.

kill(it) examines mship_ptr of all objects being killed and calls mship_release_mem
if the ptr is set.

The structure of the motherships memory block is defined in 3d_structured_def.h


Galactic Map
лллллллллллл
Has:
800 slots for motherships.
400 slots for planets
400 slots for other bg scenary
100 slots for specials - such as asteroid fields, special objects, space cow
herds, warpholes etc.

These are split over four quadrants evenly.


Generation
First 400 planets are randomly generated.
Next the 700 motherships are filled according to their supply routes
Finally we generate the 400 bg objects and poke in any manual items.

When motherships are scrolled out of the active OCB's we save their info in the galactic map.
We also save up to 50 ship positions out of the current OCB's when saving the game along with Zex's
state.


Scales
лллллл
Each quadrant covers about 50e6 units. The upper left of the galaxy is at 0,100e6;
hence the galaxy extends to 100e6 in x and to 0 in y.

The quadrant is split into 10 by 10 sections; each section covering 5e6 square units.
Objects within this area are loaded into the active OCB's. Self generated objects
should be loaded away from the edges of the section. When zex crosses a section we
unload the active OCB's and load in the new ones. An exception to this are any ships
within the immediate vicinity of Zex (i.e. long range radar scan) - these are left in
the active OCB's.

When a player moves into a new section we have to populate it not only with the items from the 
galactic map but also with ships derived from the motherships in that section.


Control
ллллллл
A task in map_control (run_map_control) runs every 76 frames. It checks zex's position
against the map and then does the right thing.


Planet Names
лллллллллллл
Are generated from a random seed.
Function gen_name takes a 32 bit seed and a pointer to a c string.
