行行行行行行行行行行
Zex accepts files in the Mesh format. To create a Zex object,
first create an object in a 3d program that can output in DXF format.
There are zillions of these things about. Import the 3DMF file into meshwork,
and save as a meshwork file. Rename the file Obj0.z and place next to and run Zex
to see it.
Meshwork can also be used as a basic creation/editor tool.
