ZEX: THE STORY
CHAPTER 1

THE WAITING ROOM OF GENERAL JOHNSON WAS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THE 
LONE FIGURE LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW. CAPTAIN DANIEL ROBERTS 
GAZED OUT AT THE DESOLATION, SCOURING THE BLACKENED EARTH, 
SEARCHING FOR THE MEREST HINT OF GREEN. BUT IT HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN 
THIS WAY. 10 YEARS AGO THE FIELDS SURROUNDING THIS AIR FORCE 
BASE WERE GREEN ROLLING GRASSLAND, WITH SMALL BUT THICK COPSES 
OF TALL OAKS. BUT THAT WAS GONE. THE DAYS BEFORE THE WAR WERE 
DAYS OF BLISS, WHERE BEING IN THE MILITARY WAS JUST ENDLESS 
DRILLS AND MOVEMENTS, BUT NOW THE MILITARY WAS STRETCHED TO 
BREAKING POINT.

THE DAY ALL THIS CHANGED WAS JUNE 27TH 2001.

THREE WEEKS BEFORE, SCIENTISTS AT CAPE KENNEDY ANNOUNCED THAT 
THEY HAD RECEIVED SIGNALS FROM SPACE. THESE SIGNALS WERE 
COMPARABLE WITH MORSE CODE. THE GOVERNMENT THREW RESOURCES INTO 
THIS, BUILDING MASSIVE TEAMS TO BREAK THESE CODES. THE GOVERNMENT 
WANTED TO BE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO CONTACT AN ALIEN INTELLIGENCE. 
SO WHEN THE MESSAGE PROMISED PEACE THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTED THIS 
WITH A BELIEF THAT VERGED ON NAIVETŽ.

IT WAS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY THE DAY THEY CAME. TEN THOUSAND 
PEOPLE WERE THERE, WITH THE PRESIDENT LOOKING UP WAITING FOR THE 
SHIPS TO APPEAR. THE AWE FILLED GASPS SOUNDED LOUDLY IN THE 
RELATIVE SILENCE AS TEN THOUSAND FACES GAZED UPWARDS WATCHING THE 
SIX BLACK DOTS IN THE CLEAR BLUE SKY. THEY GOT CLOSER AND 
CLOSER UNTIL WE COULD CLEARLY MAKE OUT THEIR DESIGN.
THE SHIPS WERE TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE, LONG POINTED BROWS THAT 
GLEAMED BLACKLY LIKE OILED STEEL. THEIR SLEEK LINES GAVE THEM 
ALMOST A SINISTER ASPECT, IT WAS LIKE GAZING UPON PREDATORS; 
SMOOTH AND DEADLY. THERE WERE GUN TURRETS ON BOTH TOP AND BOTTOM 
SURFACES OF THE SHIPS. WHY ARE THERE SO MANY GUNS ON SHIPS OF 
PEACE?

CLOSER AND CLOSER THE SHIPS CAME UNTIL THEY BLOCKED OUT THE 
SUN.

A MICROPHONE CRACKLED AS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE.
"THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH WELCOME YOU AND OFFER OUR HAND ACROSS 
THE GALAXY IN A SIGN OF PEACE."

THE ALIENS REPLY WAS SHORT BUT IT MADE ITS POINT CLEARLY.
MULTIPLE BEAMS OF ENERGY BURST FROM THE SHIPS LAYING WASTE TO 
ALL THEY TOUCHED. THE PRESIDENTS TERM OF OFFICE DIED THAT DAY 
ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE THAT HOPED TO GREET THE ALIENS.
THE EARTH WAS THROWN INTO PANIC, AS THESE SHIPS OF DESTRUCTION 
SPED AROUND THE GLOBE LAYING CITIES TO WASTE. MILLIONS DIED IN 
THOSE FIRST FEW DAYS.

FOR REASONS UNKNOWN TO OURSELVES THE MAIN SHIPS MOVED INTO 
ORBIT AND LAUNCHED THOUSANDS OF FIGHTER SHIPS AGAINST US.
THE CIVILIAN MASSES FLED TO THE MANY MILITARY BASES ACROSS THE 
GLOBE, THINKING THAT THEY WOULD BE SAFER IF THEY WERE PROTECTED 
BY OUR MEN OF WAR. THE BASES COULD NOT COPE WITH THE INFLUX OF 
PEOPLE AND MANY WERE FORCED TO FLEE OUT IN TO THE OPEN COUNTRY, 
HIDING IN THE WOODS AND HILLS STAYING WAY FROM ANY BUILT UP 
AREA THAT WAS SYSTEMATICALLY ATTACKED. IT WAS LIKE MAN WAS BEING 
PUT BACK TO THE DARK AGES.

WE RESPONDED WITH AIR STRIKES ON THESE ALIEN CRAFTS. OUR PILOTS 
FAIRED POORLY. THEIR SHIPS WERE ALL BUT INVUNERABLE TO MACHINE 
GUN FIRE AND ALTHOUGH OUR MISSILES COULD DESTROY THEM, WE COULD 
NOT GET "MISSILE LOCK" ON THEIR SHIPS AND HAD TO HIT OUR 
TARGETS MANUALLY. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THREE YEARS LATER DID OUR 
SCIENTISTS DISCOVER WHAT EMISSIONS THEIR SHIPS PRODUCED THAT COULD BE 

USED TO LOCK OUR MISSILES TO THEIR SHIPS. IN THREE YEARS SIX 
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PILOTS LOST THEIR LIVES.
ANY PILOT WHO SURVIVED THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS WAS GOOD. THIS 
IS HOW CAPTAIN ROBERTS SHOT UP THE RANKS. SIXTY FOUR SORTIES IN 
THE FIRST THREE YEARS; HE ACCOMPLISHED THEM ALL AND CHALKED UP 
EIGHTY SEVEN "KILLS".
ONCE WE GAINED THE TECHNOLOGY TO "LOCK ON" TO OUR TARGETS WE 
STARTED EVENING UP THE SCORE AND IN THE NEXT SIX YEARS THE SKIES 
BECAME EVEN.

ON THE GROUND WE WERE BETTER OFF; DUE TO OUR LARGE NUMBERS THE 
INTIAL ALIEN RUSH WAS STOPPED WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. IT THEN 
BECAME A BATTLE OT ATTRITION. HEAVY CASUALTIES WERE SUFFERED ON 
BOTH SIDES UNTIL THE ALIENS GAVE UP AND AIMED PURELY FOR THE 
DOMINATION OF THE SKIES. ONCE THEY DESTROYED OUR AERIAL 
CAPABILITIES THEY COULD MOP UP THE FINAL RESISTANCE.

THE WAR NOW IS ALMOST AT A STALEMATE, NEITHER SIDE HAS THE 
SPARE RESOURCES TO MAKE THAT FINAL MAJOR ASSAULT AND WIN THE WAR. 
IT HAS NOW TURNED INTO A WAITING GAME. LATELY IT HAS BEEN 
QUIET, TOO QUIET.

CAPTAIN ROBERTS SNAPPED OUT OF HIS PONDERINGS AS A VOICE 
CRACKLED OVER THE INTERCOM.
"OK ROBERTS I'M READY TO SEE YOU."

EVEN OVER THE INTERCOM CAPTAIN ROBERTS COULD HEAR THE STRAIN IN 
GENERAL JOHNSON'S VOICE. A STRANGE ANXIETY CAME OVER ROBERTS AS 
HIS HAND REACHED FOR THE DOOR HANDLE, IT WAS LIKE A TINY VOICE 
IN HIS HEAD SAYING,"RUN DANIEL, RUN!".ROBERTS TOOK A DEEP 
BREATH, QUELLING THE RISING PANIC AND OPENED THE DOOR.
HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE TWO OTHER PEOPLE ALREADY IN THE ROOM 
WITH THE GENERAL. 

ONE MAN WAS IN HIS EARLY THIRTIES , WIREY TO 
THE POINT OF GAUNTNESS. HE WAS SLIGHTLY BALDING, AND WHAT HAIR 
HE DID HAVE WAS WAYWARD AND UNTIDY. HIS EYES WERE A STRIKING 
BLUE COLOUR AND THEY SEEMED TO BE CONTINUALLY ROVING AROUND THE 
ROOM TAKING IN EVERY DETAIL. THE GENERAL INTRODUCED HIM AS 
SIMON PARKER, HEAD OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INTO ALIEN TECHNOLOGY. 

THE OTHER MAN WAS SO NON-DESCRIPT, IT ALMOST SEEMED 
DELIBERATE. HIS BLACK HAIR GROOMED IN A NEAT BUT PLAIN HAIR-STYLE, HIS 
AGE INDISTINGUISHABLE; ANYWHERE FROM MID THIRTIES TO LATE 
FORTIES. HIS BLACK SUIT WAS EMACULATE, WITH A CRISP WHITE SHIRT AND 
A BLACK TIE. UNLIKE THE OTHER MAN HIS FOCUS WAS ON ONE THING, 
CAPTAIN ROBERTS, AND HIS STARE WAS PIERCING, LIKE HE WAS 
EXAMINING THE CAPTAIN'S SOUL. THIS WAS JONATHAN STOKES, HEAD OF 
INTELLIGENCE. A VERY IMPORTANT MAN.

THE GENERAL LOOKED AT THE CAPTAIN AND SPOKE,"CLOSE THE DOOR SON 
AND TAKE A SEAT, YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT!"CAPTAIN ROBERTS CLOSED 
THE DOOR AND HEADED FOR HIS SEAT.



CHAPTER 2


CAPTAIN ROBERTS SAT DOWN AND GAZED AT THE GENERAL, HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF 
THE STARES HE WAS RECEIVING BUT HE WILLED HIMSELF TO STARE RESOLUTELY 
AT THE GENERAL LIKE A DROWNING MAN CLINGING TO A LIFE RAFT.

THE ROOM WAS SILENT FOR A LONG WHILE, EACH MAN MULLING OVER HIS OWN 
THOUGHTS, IT SEEMED THAT THE GENERAL WAS BUILDING UP TO SAY SOMETHING 
BUT COULDNÕT FIND THE WORDS TO START.  FINALLY WITH A SIGH HE SPOKE,

ÒWHAT I MUST MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR SON IS THAT ALL THIS IS TOTALLY 
CONFIDENTIAL, WHAT YOU HEAR HERE  MUST NOT BE REPEATED, DO YOU UNDERSTAND 
CAPTAIN?Ó

ÒYES SIRÓ, ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SHARPLY.

ÒITÕS BEEN VERY QUIET LATELYÓ, CONTINUED THE GENERAL.

ÒAND THROUGH INTELLIGENCE REPORTS WE HAVE RECEIVED, IT IS NOW CLEAR 
THAT THE ENEMY IS ON THE MOVE.   THE PROBLEM IS SON, ITS THEIR FINAL 
MOVE, THEIR ACE CARD.  IT COULD MEAN THE END OF THE WAR.  IT COULD MEAN 
THE END OF THE HUMAN RACE!Ó SHOUTED THE GENERAL .

ÒBUT HOW COULD....Ó TRAILED OFF THE CAPTAIN AS THE GENERAL INTERRUPTED 
HIM.

ÒIT SEEMS THAT THEIR TACTICS HAVE CHANGED.  THEY ARE PLACING IONIC 
DEVICES AROUND THE GLOBE, WHICH THEY ARE GOING TO DETONATE AND DESTROY 
THE EARTH.Ó

ÒTHAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE!Ó INTERJECTED  SIMON PARKER.

ÒIF MY CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT THE LOCATIONS OF THESE DEVICES ARE 
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.  IF THESE DEVICES ARE DETONATED IN QUICK 
SUCCESSION, THE EARTH WILL BE BLOWN OFF ITS STANDARD ORBIT PLUNGING IT INTO 
ANOTHER ICE AGE.  FROM WHAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED FROM AUTOPSIES OF 
RÕMPARYANS KILLED IN BATTLE IS THAT THEIR PHYSIOLOGY WOULD ALLOW THEM TO 
EXIST IN EXTREMES OF HOT OR COLD, SO THE ICE AGE WOULD DESTROY MAN BUT 
THE RMPARYANS WOULD LIVE ONE AND INHABIT THE PLANET.

WE COULD NOT AT FIRST COMPREHEND THEIR INTENTIONS, A PLAN OF THIS 
MAGNITUDE IS BEYOND HUMAN CAPABILITY, IF I WERE NOT SO SCARED I WOULD BE 
IMPRESSED WITH THE LEVEL OF THINKING THE RÕMPARYANÕS HAVE.Ó

ÒI AM OF COURSE DISTRESSED SIR, BUT WHAT HAS THIS EXACTLY GOT TO DO 
WITH ME, SURELY THIS IS INFORMATION FOR MY SUPERIORSÓ, SAID THE 
CAPTAIN.

THE GENERAL REPLIED,

ÒWELL YES, BUT THIS IS WHERE IS GETS TRICKY.  IF WE SEND A FULL FORCE 
AGAINST THESE DEVICES WE WILL GIVE AWAY  THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE AND 
THEY WILL DETONATE THESE DEVICES.  SECONDLY WHAT WE HAVE LEARNT IS THAT 
EACH OF THESE IONIC DEVICES IS GUARDED BY POWERFUL SHIPS THAT OUR 
CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS COULD NOT DAMAGE.Ó

ÒSO WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE GOING TO DO?Ó ASKED THE CAPTAIN.

ÒSON, WE HAVE CREATED A WEAPON OF INCREDIBLE POWER. THIS WEAPON COULD 
DESTROY THESE SHIPS AND IONIC DEVICES.  BUT MR PARKER KNOWS A GREAT 
DEAL MORE THAN ME.Ó

SIMON PARKER CLEARED HIS THROAT AND BEGAN,

ÒABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO THREE OF OUR FIGHTERS TOOK DOWN A RÕMPARYAN 
FIGHTER JUST OVER DALLAS, UNLIKE ALL OTHER CASES THE SHIPÕS SELF 
DESTRUCT MECHANISM FAILED, AN INCREDIBLE DEVICE THAT WORKS ON THE PILOTS 
BRAIN WAVES, STOP THE BRAIN WAVES AND BOOM!!!  SORRY IÕM GETTING OFF 
THE SUBJECT.

WELL THIS FIGHTER WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE LABORATORY AND ABOUT 95% OF 
THE SYSTEMS WERE OPERATIONAL.  LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE RÕMPARYANS 
HAVE OPENED OUR EYES AND REDEFINED EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT PROPULSION 
AND AIRCRAFT CONSTRUCTION. 

THE CONTROL SYSTEM IS BEYOND ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT. 
 IT HAS NEURAL CONTROL, ITS CONTROLLED BY THOUGHT!  THE PILOTS UNDERGO 
SURGERY TO ADD IMPLANTS INTO THEIR BRAIN SO THEY CAN ÔJACKÕ INTO THE 
SHIP.  

THE WEAPON SYSTEMS ARE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL, EVEN THE STANDARD CANNONS 
CAN PIERCE 18 INCH THICK STEEL.  I AM AT THIS MOMENT WORKING ON 
LASERS.  I WAS ALMOST AT THE POINT OF BELIEVING THAT WE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE 
PRODUCE ENOUGH POWER IN SUCH A SMALL GENERATOR, BUT AS I SAID BEFORE 
THEIR TECHNOLOGY HAS ALLOWED US  TO EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING, ITS A 
PITY WE HAVE TO DESTROY THEM.

FROM ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE CREATED A SHORT RANGE FIGHTER WITH 
MORE DESTRUCTIVE POWER THAN ALL OUR OTHER AIRCRAFT PUT TOGETHER.  IT 
USES RÕMPARYAN TECHNOLOGY  AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE GUESSED AND WITH A FEW 
MODIFICATIONS OF MY OWN IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL FIGHTER ON THE PLANET, 
HUMAN OR OTHERWISE.
 
IÕM PROUD TO ADMIT THOUGH THAT I HAVE IMPROVED THEIR STANDARD ENGINES 
AND OUR SHIP IS NOW ALMOST TWICE AS FAST AS A F14.Ó

THE GENERAL INTERJECTED,

ÒWE NEED A PILOT SON, AND YOUR THE BEST.Ó

ÒTHE SURGERY IS MINOR, THERE WILL BE NO COMPLICATIONS, IT SHOULD TAKE 
ABOUT HALF AN HOURÓ  BUTTED IN SIMON PARKER QUICKLY, GAUGING THE 
ARGUMENT THAT WAS BUILDING UP IN THE CAPTAIN.

ÒLOOK, IT MIGHT BE A CLICHE SON, BUT IN THIS CASE ITS TRUE.  YOUR 
COUNTRY NEEDS YOU, IN FACT THE HUMAN RACE NEEDS YOU!Ó SAID THE GENERAL ON 
HIS FEET AND RED FACED WITH EMOTION.

ÒI HAVE LITTLE CHOICE IN THE MATTER.Ó

ÒTRUE, BUT I WOULD PREFER YOU DOING THIS WILLINGLY.Ó  SAID THE 
GENERAL.

ÒI'LL BE HONEST SIR, I'M NOT DOING IT FOR MY COUNTRY, OR FOR THE HUMAN 
RACE, I'M DOING IT FOR MY WIFE AND SON.Ó 

SIMON PARKER ALMOST LOOKED GLEEFUL, HE NOW HAD THE TEST PILOT FOR HIS 
GREATEST CREATION.  

ÒIN THE OPERATION WE WILL ALSO INSTALL A PROGRAM THAT WILL  TEACH YOU 
ALL THE CONTROLS OF THE SHIP INSTANTLY, SO NO LEARNING CURVE, YOUÕLL 
BE AN EXPERT IMMEDIATELY, AND COMBINED WITH YOUR FIGHTING SKILLS WE 
COULDN'T BE IN BETTER HANDS.Ó

ÒSO WHAT THIS SHIP CALLED THEN,Ó  SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH A VOICE FULL 
OF DETERMINATION.

ÒZEX,Ó SAID SIMON PARKER.

ÒIT'S CALLED ZEX.Ó
