# Zex
2D Space Game with 3D graphics

Zex is a 1998 space-trading game with 2D game area but with 3D objects rendered with a software render. 

It was written by Stuart Ball and Rob Probin.

In 2005, Rob started to convert the underlying Mac game to SDL (using a custom made Mac-classic abstraction layer) and make the game cross platform. Soon Stu and others involved in the original development joined in this effort. Apart that there were minor changes to get it building (and fix the odd bug) in 2010 and 2015.

We haven’t checked the wormholes still work.

NOTE: The game and manual refer to lightsoft.co.uk - but that web site doesn’t really exist except as placeholder currently.


## REPOSITORY OVERVIEW

All source code is available and released as open source.

Project files are provided for Mac OS, Windows and Open Pandora. Since the Open Pandora is Linux already we don’t think a x86 desktop Linux port would be difficult at all. You might need to squish some bugs…

.ZLV files are level files and are text files.

.z files are 3D model “mesh” files (exported with a program called ‘Meshworks’).

RAW are raw texture files - and are binary.

.rbs are various files that were copied from the Mac resources. These can be considered binary files, but in reality things are not that simple :-) These contain text, graphics and other data.

Sadly, no original graphics source files are present in the repository currently, but reverse engineering the rbs files is probably possible. We probably have the originals somewhere on a CD…
